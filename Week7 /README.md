##  Week 7 - Transformations / Aggregations in Python

### Course content
- Finish off developing a "JOIN" in Python

# Join the two DataFrames on a common column
- Replace 'common_column' with the name of the column that the two tables have in common

```py
#   JOIN Syntax
df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column', how='left')
```


Then: 
- Understanding what functions are and why they're useful
- Using built-in Python functions - len(), str(), int()
- Defining your own functions based on the transformations. 
- Understanding function arguments and return values
